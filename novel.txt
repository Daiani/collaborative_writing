He didn't know why they were there... but they were. 
They were watching his every move.
They slowly moved towards him as he slept.
Sensing his dreams through their tentacles. 
And after that, they had some ice cream.
Now they are thinking.
Wondering how he sensed their evil presence but was not frightened.
But at least they had ice cream.
